**1. Remake decs & defineVar - DONE
*2. Listen needs to use symbolTableEntry - Almost Done - needs listen
**3. Function for setting up relative addressing for symbol table -> DONE probs

4. Shout needs to be updated to be able to shout floats, cheeses and hip hips
**5. Need a function for creating temporary variables for results of expressions -> DONE
** and float lits, cheese lits and bool lits

6. Make shout work for variables, expressions and cheeses
7. Assignment operations
8. Arithmetic expression evaluation
9. Set up initial values as found in reference doc
10. Hiphip/cheese declarations and initializations
11. Boolean expression evaluation
12. If statements (with nesting)
13. Select...case statement implementation (with nesting)

Note: Make initializations and assignments the same code block so we
don't have to keep track of if it is the first time something
has been assigned or not.

TALK TO MARTY: listen for bools -> how to store them, how to read them  what we want them to do
