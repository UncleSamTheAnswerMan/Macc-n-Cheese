1. Remake decs & defineVar
2. Listen needs to use symbolTableEntry
3. Function for setting up relative addressing for symbol table
4. Shout needs to be updated to be able to shout floats, cheeses and hip hips
5. Need a function for creating temporary variables for results of expressions
   and float lits, cheese lits and bool lits
6. Make shout work for variables
7. Assignment operations
8. Arithmetic expression evaluation
9. Set up initial values as found in reference doc

Note: Make initializations and assignments the same code block so we
don't have to keep track of if it is the first time something
has been assigned or not.
